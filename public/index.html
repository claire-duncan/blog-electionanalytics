        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            This week in Election Analytics, we covered incumbency as it creates advantages and disadvantages in election cycles. While incumbent politicians tend to be reelected, incumbent parties tend to do worse, especially in midterm years as the President’s party tends to lose the House.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            This week in Election Analytics, we covered polling as a predictor of election results. Polling is central to understanding what the electorate wants and how they believe the government is working to achieve those goals and needs. Polling also generally allows for knowing the average opinion of the population as it can uncover a true estimate through canceling out the errors and outliers that occur within a polling sample.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            In week two of Election Analytics, we focused on economic forces and the effect of various measures of economic well-being at the ballot box. Do voters punish candidates when the economy is doing poorly? Do they focus on only the short-term effects or the long-term changes over time?

            Hi! My name is Claire Duncan and I’m a junior studying government and psychology at Harvard. From now until November 8, Election Day, I will be updating this blog every week with a prediction model for the upcoming 2022 US midterm elections. This week, the focus is on setting up the blog and creating visualizations of Democratic/Republican vote share and seat share during previous election years - in particular, the 2020 House of Representatives general election.
