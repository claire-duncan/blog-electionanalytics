      <description>Hi! My name is Claire Duncan and Iâ€™m a junior studying government and psychology at Harvard. From now until November 8, Election Day, I will be updating this blog every week with a prediction model for the upcoming 2022 US midterm elections. This week, the focus is on setting up the blog and creating visualizations of Democratic/Republican vote share and seat share during previous election years - in particular, the 2020 House of Representatives general election.</description>
